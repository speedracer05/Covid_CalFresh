1. Scope: Correlation of covid, unemployment and rise of SNAP overtime
	1a. Supposition: As Covid infection rates increased, so did CalFresh enrollement
		i. What are the top 5 infected counties
		ii. 

	1b. Timeframe: Jan 2020 to Mar 2021
	1c. Geography CA
	1d. Completion by Saturday, May 1st0

2. Datasets Selected
	2a. CalFresh. https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/research-and-data/calfresh-data-tables/dfa256
	2b. US_Counties. https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
	2c. US Census. https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html

3. Approach
	3a. Story. How did Covid affect the various counties
	3b. Starting with a wide-view, nationally, then zoom into county

4. Visualization
	a. Show counties with the largest covid, snap and unemployement.
	b. What is the story we want to paint
		b1. Show top 5 (infections), worst hit (infection rate), least affected counties 
		b2. Index (B1), Series Months 1-15 (jan 2020 - mar 2021
		b3. Track infection rates as function of population. Hypothesis. Rural areas may have high rates --not following guidelines
		b4. Heatmap. Infection rates by counties
		b5. 
	c. What information we need to display
		f1. Bargraph
		f2. Heatmap/geo-code
		f3. Line graph

5. Time Permitting Options
	a. # Add income demographic. 
	b. # County color tier system.
	c. Use Census API
6. Open Questions
	a. Verify Requirements

Brainstorm Questions. 

1. Presentation, stay high-level; what is the problem; what is the conclusion; want to understand the data (overview)
	a. During presentation, need to discuss the datasets explored
	b. What we did with the data

Next Actions Check-in Monday. Slack
1. Data clean up. CalFresh Date "strip month-", persons, isolate to 2020, drop unnecessary columns (DeJuan)
2. Data clean up. Counties, "3 columns month, date and year" and consolidate days into months, Isolate to CA, drop FIPS column (Jackson)
3. Data cleanup. Census data. Drop unnecessary columns, filter State to CA only. (Siddarth)
4. Review requirements and place into file note (John)
5. Add Suppusition info. Merge by date, check for nulls, (John)

What Comparisons are needed to create dataframes/groups?
1. Compare separate data sets (CA agg)
	1a. Deaths month over
	1b. Unemployment month over month month
	1c. CalFresh spend month over month
	1d. CalFresh people month over month
2. Compare separate data sets (top 5 counties)
	a.
	b.
	c.
	d.
3. Correlations
	a. Unemployment rate, CalFresh people, Covid Cases
	b. Correlation of 5 highly impacted ares over time
	c. How the Covid affected counties with high population, in terms of CalFresh uptake
4. Visualization of
	a. Heat map of highest population vs Covid cases to see if it lines up.
	b. Heat map unemployment rate, correlation to CalFresh enrollment.

5. Suppsition of Data
	a. Increase in unemployment in EDD kept increase of CalFresh in check
	b. Larger density translates to larger percentage of deaths
	c. ##Prj 2. Medicade/Medical impact
	d. ?Is there a higher impact of infection per person in rural vs dense population areas
