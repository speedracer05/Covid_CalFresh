		b1. Show top 5, worst hit, least affected counties
		b2. )
	c. What information we need to display
		f1. Bargraph
		f2. Heatmap/geo-code
		f3. Line graph

5. Time Permitting Options
	a. # Add income demographic. 
	b. # County color tier system.

Brainstorm Questions. 

1. Presentation, stay high-level; what is the problem; what is the conclusion; want to understand the data (overview)

Next Actions Check-in Monday. Slack
1. DONE- Data clean up. CalFresh Date "strip month-", persons, isolate to 2020, drop unnecessary columns (DeJuan)
2. OPEN - Data clean up. Counties, "3 columns month, date and year" and consolidate days into months, Isolate to CA, drop FIPS column (Jackson)
3. OPEN - Data cleanup. Census data. Drop unnecessary columns, filter State to CA only. (Siddarth)
4. Review requirements and place into file note (John)
5. Add Suppusition info. Merge by date, check for nulls, (John)

What Comparisons are needed to create dataframes/groups?
1. Compare separate data sets (CA agg)
	1a. Deaths month over
	1b. Unemployment month over month month
	1c. CalFresh spend month over month
	1d. CalFresh people month over month
2. Compare separate data sets (top 5 counties)
	a.
	b.
	c.
	d.
3. Correlations
	a. Unemployment rate, CalFresh people, Covid Cases
	b. Correlation of 5 highly impacted ares over time
	c. How the Covid affected counties with high population, in terms of CalFresh uptake
4. Visualization of
	a. Heat map of highest population vs Covid cases to see if it lines up.
	b. Heat map unemployment rate, correlation to CalFresh enrollment.

5. Suppsition of Data
	a. Increase in unemployment in EDD kept increase of CalFresh in check
	b. Larger density translates to larger percentage of deaths
	c. ##Prj 2. Medicade/Medical impact
	d. ?Is there a higher impact of infection per person in rural vs dense population areas
